# ASP.NET.CORE.WEB.DEMO

This is an ongoing project that will be added to regularly with new features as and when I have time to do so.

The purpose of this is to provide a rough guide to developing web apps using ASP.NET Core in .NET 7.  Everything is included from adding new razor pages to using razor components
(blazor) for enhanced user interactivity.

Please feel free to fork this repo for your own purposes but if you do make any amendments or additions please 
keep them in your own repo and not on this one.
